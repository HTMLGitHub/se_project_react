*Intro*

WTWR is a weather tracking web app that will suggest what should be worn depending on the current tempature. The call to the https://openweathermap.org/ API using (currently hard coded) longitude and laditude. The app then gathers needed information from the API (location, tempature, condition) and displays the city, tempature, and shows a banner with the current condition (right now limited to clear, raining, snowing, cloudy, and lightning (thunderstorm)). Using the tempature, the app then displays clothing approperate for outdoor use. 

If the user clicks on the clothing a popup showing an enlarged image of the clothing along with a brief description. The 'Add Clothes' button will open a popup where the user (in future revisions) can add additional clothing.

## Improvements

Basic improvement will be adding clothing via the popup created. Perhaps adding additional functionality to allow for all weather conditions (brought in via API) to display in the banner. Also, have a profile editing, to change the image and name, as well as the location of the user.

Will be created later
